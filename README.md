# Distance-Estimation-in-Hololens-New
 
This is a HoloLens App where we are interested to see how people can judge distance of a life size human avatar if we add a side-by-side walking animation to it at various distances. The avatar will walk around 10 meters, 25 meters, and 40 meters. The user first need to look at the ground when the app will start running to let the HoloLens detect the floor by itself. Whenever the user will see the default mouse pointer of the HoloLens can detect the floor, he/she needs to do an air tap gesture, and baam, the avatar will start walking around 10 meters ahead of the user. To teleport the avatar at various distances, the user only needs to do the air tap gesture every time. The App will teleport the avatar at various distances randomly. This randomness is incorporated to reduce the ordering effect.

A small Demo can be found here...

Here you can see the HoloLens app, as well as the same app running in an iPhone as well, using ARKit.
